# UFO Sighting Visualization

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to take in data around UFO sitings and create a visually appealing and easily consumable way of understanding and filtering the data. By incorporating various filter method options for the user this data can be leveraged to search on several different parameters. 

## Results
This data can be leveraged to understand where and when UFO sitings have been reported as well as understanding what was seen to see if there are any similar reports that have came through

## Summary 
One drawback to this method of filtering is that it is not apparently clear what would make good filters for the data. this leaves the filters up to the user to guess and check

Two ways this could be improved: 
- Include supporting summary statistics that show breakdowns to filter upon

- implement data validation to prohibit entries that return no records.
